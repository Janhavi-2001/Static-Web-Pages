**1. HTML**

HTML, which stands for 'HyperText Markup Language', forms the backbone of designing a webpage. It is a means of giving structure to the webpage and elaborates on where to place certain contents in it. The syntax of an HTML page is as follows:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

Where,

- The ```<!DOCTYPE html>``` declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
- The ```<html>``` element is the root element of an HTML page
- The ```<head>``` element contains meta information about the HTML page
- The ```<title>``` element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
- The ```<body>``` element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
- The ```<h1>``` element defines a large heading
- The ```<p>``` element defines a paragraph

**2. CSS**

CSS, which stands for 'Cascading Style Sheets', is a language used to customise and style plain HTML web pages. It also describes how certain HTML elements are to be placed on the web page. Statements in CSS can either be inline in the HTML document, or can be referenced externally. The syntax of an external CSS page is as follows:

```css

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}
```

Where, 

- The selector ```h1``` points to the HTML element you want to style.
- The declaration block ``` {color: white; text-align: center;}``` contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
- Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
- Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
